### Files

- **Influenza Death Report.pdf**:

A detailed interim report analyzing influenza mortality trends in the United States, focusing on:

      - Age-based mortality trends.
      - Statistical and correlation analysis between population size and flu deaths.
      - Research hypothesis testing to highlight vulnerable age groups.
      - Next steps include developing visualizations and refining findings for stakeholders
      - An Excel workbook featuring data aggregation and statistical analyses of influenza death rates across various age groups.

- **Excel File Details - Comparison of Influenza Death Rate by Age.xlsx**:

      - Tab 1: Final Integrated Data
            - Contains aggregated influenza mortality data by state and year.
            - Includes columns for various age groups (e.g., "Under 5 Years," "85 And Over").
            - Serves as the foundational dataset for trend analysis and statistical modeling.
      - Tab 2: Statistical Analysis
            - Analyzes influenza deaths for specific age groups (e.g., 45-54, 85+ years).
            - Explores whether the data follows a normal distribution to validate assumptions for further analysis.
            - Provides observations and inferences for targeted interventions.
      - Tab 3: Statistical Analysis 1
            - Focuses on age group 75-84, analyzing correlation and distribution.
            - Includes findings that establish the relationship between population size and influenza death rates in this demographic.
            - Highlights actionable insights for public health planning.
### Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Aggregation**: Combining datasets across multiple dimensions (age, state, year).
- **Statistical Analysis**: Normality testing, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- **Visualization Planning**: Developing impactful visualizations (e.g., line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms).
- **Domain Knowledge**: Understanding public health insights, particularly influenza mortality trends and resource planning.
